# Rotate3D

Rotate3D is a 3D Program that rotated a Cube in the beginning using OpenGL and own mathematics, but now it is aiming more to a very simple "engine", being able to render multiple buildings (which are hardcoded) by calling one function each time. It is for educational purpose only.

The objects are just rendered by lines, but I do calculations to determine if a object is in front or behind the camera, to skip a polygon and save rendering resources.
