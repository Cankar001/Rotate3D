# Rotate3D

Rotate3D is a 3D Program that rotated a Cube in the beginning using OpenGL and own mathematics, but now it is aiming more to a very simple "engine", being able to render multiple instances of a building (which is hardcoded) by using the same vertex data and performing a transform manipulation for each instance. 

The objects are just rendered just with lines, but I do calculations to determine if a object is in front or behind the camera, to skip a polygon and save rendering resources.
